Marked all researches as leeani-exclusive in their descriptions.
Nerfed leeani leather insulation from 2.0 to 1.1
Organic tail is marked as Leeani tail
Juniper: MarketValue 1.5 -> 1.2, daysToRotStart 40 -> 60 (basically an option for strawberry which can last without fridge, but is not tasty when raw)
Berry juice: value 25 -> 7, recipe now requires 30 of any berries instead of fixed berries/juniper ratio
Grapes: value 3.5 -> 3.25, preferability RawBad -> RawTasty
Grape juice: value 25 -> 7, nutrition 0.5 -> 0.2
Quarterstaff: commonality of "middle" attack decreased, can Poke

Backstories with violent backgrounds can't be applied to non-violent pawns.
Bycocket is marked as leeani-exclusive, since its shape does not work with human heads. WorkToMake and MaxHitPoints are set to reasonable values.
Outlander Union has a small chance to have a Leeani mercenary as caravan or base guard.

Scenarios:
Fixed initial tech level for scenario (was Ultra).
Reduced apparel budget from 1000-2400 to 500-1000.
Traditions and cider brewing are unlocked at start for Leeani faction.
Start with 3 great bows and 2 wooden quarterstaves instead of two bolt-action rifles (kinda outside their tech tree) and one plasteel quarterstaff (it is impossible to even make one).
Reworked starting apparel to be reasonably medieval. No tribal junk or spacer tech.

Built-in mod support:
EPOE (except for ribs, I have no idea why they don't work)
Misc. CORE (BrainPal surgery)
Mechanoids Extraordinare (mecha-tentacle surgery)
[FSF] Efficient Utilities and Efficient Light (Lamp-post efficiency)

Things to consider:

Trim tech tree (too much small researches) and remove juniper (it is redundant). Would break saves though.
Make their scenario more medieval. No electricity, but more low tech unlocked.
Rename InstallClothTail recipe to avoid possible overrides by other race mods.
