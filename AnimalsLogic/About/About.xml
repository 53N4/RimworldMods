	<description>Several QoL fixes related to the animal behavior:
 — In caravan forming and trade interface adds tags to distinguish bonded, trained and pregnant animals.
 — Changes pack-able animals without a load to be considered a sellable chattel by the caravans.
 — Unforbids slaughtered animals.
 — Egg-layers are trying to find a sleeping spot or other animal bed in their allowed area to lay an egg. Unforbids eggs laid outside the home area.
 — Predators hunting your pawns (human-like or animals) are considered hostile by all your pawns and turrets.
 — Assign animal beds to specific animals.
 — Assign medical beds for animals.
 — (Optional) Prevents animals from eating random stuff.
 — (Optional) Lessens wildness penalty for training (but not taming) animals.
 — (Experimental) Animals have greater chance to fight back when attacked in melee.</description>
